2Rooms' Website Upgrade

This project is intended as an upgrade of the existing website of my friend's catering business in Hong Kong.

Website address: www.2rooms.com.hk

UX

Having discussed in length, my friend would like to have an eye-catching website with hero images across each page to draw attention. She would also like to include a photo gallery.

The website will still consist of the current number of pages, but the layout and content will be simplified for easy navigation and to keep visitors engaged.

What she wants to achieve is a clean, straightforward and welcoming webpage that will appeal to new visitors as well as existing customers.

Features

The website will be fully responsive to different screen sizes. Where appropriate, images will not be displayed to minimise distraction from the content.

The photos are arranged in the porfolio page with captions to showcase the wide range of services provided and customised products available.

Feature Left to Implement

Tab to enlarge photos in portfolio

Issues

Contact form currently has no valid http weblink hence showing invalid page after submitting.

The website was developed initially using repl.it and then copied across as there were constant issues with Gitpod in terms of loading the webages and changes for preview.

Given the time difference between Hong Kong and the UK, this has caused some delays in the design process and scheduling online meetings to discuss specific requirements.

In addition, it has taken my friend and I considerable time to collate the photos that are of good quality and suitable to use in the website.

Overall, my friend is happy with the end result and feels it is an improvement to her current website.

Deployment

Problems identified by Gitpod were corrected and changes were committed. 

HTML code checked using W3C HTML Validator.

CSS code checked using W3C CSS Validator.

Credits

Content

The content text was extracted from the existing company website.

Media

The photos used in this site were obtained from my friend directly and shared privately via Dropbox.
