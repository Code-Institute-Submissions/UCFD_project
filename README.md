# 2Rooms' Kitchen Website Upgrade

This project is intended as an upgrade of the existing website of my friend's catering business in Hong Kong.

It is based on this older version (www.2rooms.com.hk).

## UX

Having discussed in length with my friend, she would like to have an eye-catching website with hero images across each page to draw attention. She would also like to include a photo gallery. The website will still consist of the current number of pages, but the layout and content will be simplified for easy navigation and to keep visitors engaged.

What she wants to achieve is a clean, straightforward and welcoming webpage that will appeal to new visitors as well as existing customers. Users should be able to find out from the website the type of catering and bakery services available, and be able to get in touch with the site ower to make enquiries. The portfolio section will showcase the capabilities of the company to cater for a wide variety of occasions and customise the menu and products accordingly.

Given the time difference between Hong Kong and the UK, this has caused some delays in the design process and scheduling online meetings to discuss specific requirements. In addition, it has taken my friend and I considerable time to collate the photos that are of good quality and suitable to use in the website. Meetings were conducted via Zoom and Whatsapp where ideas were presented. Hand-drawn wireframe shows the following: 

- Navbar with company logo to the left and page headings to the right.

- Below navbar is the hero image. There will be hero text for the home page only. 

- Page content to be split into two columns alternating with text and picture.

- Footnote section will contain liks to Facebook and Instagram.

- The same layout will basically be used across the pages for consistency.

- Portfolio page will not have a hero image, intead there will be individual image with caption arranged in squares to resemble polaroid photos.

- Contact page will show a form for submitting enquiry with company address and contact details at the bottom.

My friend is happy with the end result and feels it is an improvement to her current website and manages to achieve the goals set out. 

## Features

The website will be fully responsive to different screen sizes. Where appropriate, images will not be displayed to minimise distraction from the content.

The photos are arranged in the porfolio page with captions to display the wide range of services provided and customised products available.

Colour scheme used is in line with company logo and to create a soft and warm atmosphere. 

Font used is in line with a friendly and approachable image. 

Contact form enables users to make online enquiries. 

## Feature Left to Implement

Tab to enlarge photos in portfolio

## Issues

Contact form currently has no valid http weblink hence showing invalid page after submitting.

The website was developed initially using repl.it and then copied across as there were constant issues with Gitpod in terms of loading the webages and changes for preview.

## Testing 

Pages were checked using DevTools.

HTML code were checked using W3C HTML Validator and beautified using HTML Formatter.

CSS code were checked using W3C CSS Validator and beautified using CSS Formatter. 

During the development process, I have used the Google inspect tool to similuate viewing the pages with different mobile devices. Different browsers like Chrome, Firefox and Safari were also used to open the pages. The website is responsive to various screen sizes. 

My friend and I have used different devices like iPhones and iPads to access the website to ensure that the images and content are all displayed as they are intended. We have asked other friends with Android devices to check the website as well. I have also asked everyone for their feedback in terms of ease of navigating the pages and whether they found the website appealing. They liked the photos and colour scheme. In particular, they found the website clean and consistent where there is a good balance between pictures and text - they were able to find out what they wanted about the company services thus achieveing the goals set up above. 

## Deployment

Repository opened in Github. Workspace opened in Gitpod. 

Issues identified by Gitpod were corrected.

Changes were committed and pushed across from Gitpod to Github as initial commit. 

Readme file was updated pushed across as final commit. 

Readme file and images were further updated on Github and committed.

Following advice from tutor, improvements were made on Gitpod as follows:

- Hero images resized for standardisation. 

- Readme file has also been updated to include more details of the whole development process. 

- UX section was expanded to explain the design process and to describe the wireframes. 

- Testing section was elaborated to detail the processes carried out. 

- Asset folder was created to hold the images used and style.css file. 

- Media queries were moved to the end of the style.css file. 

All files were then pushed across from Gitpod to Github and committed ready for submission.
